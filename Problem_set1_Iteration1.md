🧠 Problem Set 1 — Progress Tracker

Welcome to the C Repository for Problem Set 1!
This repo is where I’ll be tracking my learning journey and progress through multiple iterations of Problem Set 1. 🚀

📁 Repository Overview

Repo Name: Problem_set1
Language: C 💻
Purpose: To document and version each iteration of Problem Set 1 as I improve, debug, and refine my solutions.

🔄 Iteration Naming Convention

Each folder or file follows this pattern:

Problem_set1_IterationX


Where X represents the iteration number — indicating how many version changes or improvements have been made.

💡 Example:

Problem_set1_Iteration1 → 🧩 Only one version so far

Problem_set1_Iteration5 → 🔁 Five versions of improvement and refinement

In short, the iteration number helps keep track of my evolution through the problem set — showing how my understanding and code quality progress over time. 📈

🏁 Goal

To complete and continuously refine Problem Set 1 until I achieve:

✅ Efficient and clean C code

✅ Full understanding of underlying concepts

✅ Proper documentation and version control practices

🧰 Tech Stack

Language: C

Version Control: Git & GitHub

IDE/Editor: (Add your preferred one here, e.g., VS Code, CLion, etc.)

✨ Notes

This repo acts as both a learning archive and a progress log, showing how each iteration builds upon the previous one.
Every step forward is one version closer to mastery. 💪
